# Roles explained - Data scientist and Statisticians

## Being a data scientist...

Data scientists are expected to forecast the future based on patterns; he or she is also responsible for developing questions based on the data provided. A data scientist is expected to be well-versed in computer science, statistics, and domain-specific knowledge. A solid data foundation is laid by data scientists in order to perform robust analytics. The most important aspect of being a data scientist is having the freedom to explore, to always think ahead, to uncover non-obvious insights that improve business, product, or model, to change or optimize things to make things better. With proper domain knowledge, it is applicable to many industries such as fintech, social media, food delivery, and so on. I believe there is always something new to learn in this field, which keeps the job interesting.
